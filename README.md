# Flask on Heroku

This project ties together concepts from the Data Incubator's 12-day course, including Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas, Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization.

The [orginial repository](https://github.com/thedataincubator/flask-demo) was the starting point, and a [finished example](https://lemurian.herokuapp.com) was used
for inspiration.
